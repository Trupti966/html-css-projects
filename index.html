    <p>Primarily known for its vibrant cultural heritage, Odisha surprises visitors with various hues embedded in its diverse landscape. From overarching mountains to pristine lakes, this state offers an ensemble of tradition and terrain. Of the many attractions that are known to lure tourists here, the gushing waterfalls hold a rather special position owing to their natural yet charming beauty. Here exists few of the most alluring waterfalls of Odisha that you just cannot afford to miss when at this travel destination. Strategically nestled around the Simplipal National Park, Barehipani Waterfall is the highest waterfall in Odisha. Falling from an incredible height of 399 metres, the fall breaks into two visible tiers which ultimately ends to form a pool. The sight of this mystical outpouring of water from the cliff top is breathtaking enough. But its prime location also comes with the added bonus of catching a glimpse of the natural wildlife at the park adjacent to it. Badaghagara-Waterfall is a perennial stream located in the lowly town of Kendhujar. The hike up to the summit of the dusty trail is not as cumbersome as other tracks, making it an enjoyable experience. The serrated topography is thus a major crowd-pleaser amidst nature lovers, adventure enthusiasts and photographers</p>
    <p>But above all, this natural wonder offers an unruffled time in the lap of bountiful nature. Flowing from a whopping height of 175 meters, the Duduma Waterfall is a natural scenic attraction which is a sight for the eyes! Nestled between thick coverings of deciduous trees, the waterfall seems like a gateway to paradise. Regarded as the highest plunge of waterfalls in the Jeypore area, the picturesque locales at Duduma Waterfall are ideal for daylong trips and picnics where one can simply relax and enjoy the cascading water. Basked in the midst of mineral-rich forests, the Khandadhar Waterfalls gracefully plunges from a height of 225 metres. The sight of clear water trickling down the fall is best viewed from atop the mountain. The walk is fairly arduous and the rugged tracks make a veritable trekking base for all those adventure junkies out there. With lush green forests surrounding this mighty plunge, the falls make a magnificent picnic spot and tourist attraction, offering panoramic views and a fun-filled experience.</p>
